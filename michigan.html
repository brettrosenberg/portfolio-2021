			<h2> Michigan Football</h2>
			<p> Both Brett's Grandpa and Dad attended the Univesity of Michigan which led the Rosenberg's to becoming huge Michigan sports since birth. Ever since Brett was young they would travel as a family to Ann Arbor for a weekend and come enjoy a football game at Scott's alma mater. Soon Michigan sports became the most talked about thing in their family and even family events were planned around the timing of the games. </p>

			<h2> Michigan Basketball</h2>
			<p> The Rosenbergs are much bigger basketball fans than football right now. Since Michigan became relevant after their 2013 national chmapionship run, they have attended most of the march madness tournaments that Michigan has participated in. First was their college basketball roadtrip where they went to 4 games in 5 days across the midwest where they finsihed at Michigan. They also went to the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight in Kansas City, where Michigan lost to Oregon. They also attended the big ten tournament in New York City but the pinnacle of all of these events was the Final Four and National Championship in San Antonio, Texas.  </p>
