            <h2> Trip to Israel</h2>
            <p> On the Rosenberg's Trip to Israel they visited Jerusalem first, where they stayed at the King David Hotel. While in Jerusalem they visited many of the major sites including the Western Wall and the Dome of The Rock, while also managing to have some of the best food in the world. Before they traveled to the Golan Heights they made a quick stop at Masada and the Dead Sea. </p>

            <h2> Trip to Telluride</h2>
			<p> Not only did the Rosenbergs go abroad to Israel but almost every year they try to ski out in Colorado. Most of the time they chase the snow, so whichever mountain has the most snow they go to. Here are some pictures from their trip to Telluride, Colorado.  </p>
