				<h2> The Kids</h2>
				<p> Not only is the Rosenberg household a large group of 6 but their extended family can't be forgotten either. With 16 grandchildren on Scott's side Grandpa Arthur and Grandma Les have so many birthdays to remember. There are four families on this side of the family: The Rosenbergs, The Gordons, The Moskowitzs, and The Schwartzs. As you can imagine family events can get pretty rowdy and competitive. On the other side of the family it is a bit complicated becuase of the divorces involved. Brett's mom has 1 sister, 2 step-sisters, and 2 half brothers. However, everyone considers everyone family so it all works. There are the Sachs', the Liebermans, the Lewines, and the Wilcoxs'.</p>
